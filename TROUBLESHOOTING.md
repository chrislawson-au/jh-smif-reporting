## üìÅ File Upload Issues

### Problem: "File upload failed" or upload button not working

2. **Firefox**: Ensure cookies and JavaScript are enabled
3. **Safari**: Try disabling popup blockers
4. **Edge**: Clear browser cache and try again

---

### Problem: "Error processing data" after successful upload

**Data quality issues:**
1. **Column headers**: Ensure Excel files have expected column names
2. **Date formats**: Dates should be in standard format (YYYY-MM-DD or MM/DD/YYYY)
3. **Numeric data**: Amounts should be numbers, not text with symbols
4. **Empty rows**: Remove any completely empty rows

**File structure verification:**
- **Transaction file** should have columns like: Date, Ticker, Shares, Price, Amount
- **Income file** should have columns like: Date, Description, Amount, Account

1. Re-download files from brokerage
2. Open in Excel and check for obvious errors
3. Try uploading one file at a time to isolate the problem
4. Save files with different names to avoid caching issues

---

### Problem: Upload takes too long or times out

**Network optimization:**
1. **Stable connection**: Use wired connection if possible
2. **Close other tabs**: Reduce bandwidth usage
3. **Optimal timing**: Upload during low-traffic periods
4. **File size**: Consider splitting large date ranges

**Retry strategies:**

- Upload during off-peak hours (early morning, late evening)
